In PSD to HTML conversion, it is beneficial to automate the process by using relevant software. Like other software, it also comes with a drawback as you cannot get a truly custom HTML/CSS code with software automation.  Moreover, one cannot receive a pixel-perfect conversion with a PSD file that he can gain through hand-coded interaction.  It does not mean that front-end development does not rely on automated conversions. One can use them in several instances including-  A basic Shopify-based eCommerce store A business website on Basekit or Squarespace Moral of the story is to get a hosted template website and these software serve this purpose well.
